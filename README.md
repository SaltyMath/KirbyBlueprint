# KirbyBlueprint
A tiny Kirby game made in Unreal Engine 5 with Blueprints

## Instructions
This version must be launched in the Unreal Engine because it doesn't have a .exe yet. 

When you'll be in the main menu, browse your files and select Kirby.uproject. Then go in the Content Drawer (down left) and search the Maps Folder and click on 1-1.
If done correctly, you must now be in the map editor. Simply click on the play button and on your screen to launch and play the game. To stop the game, press ESC.

## Commands

A : Go left
D : Go right
J : Suck up an enemy
S : Swallow an enemy (when mouth is full)
L : Spit an enemy (when mouth is full)
Space : Jump (5 consecutive jumps available as long as mouth isn't full)

Have fun!
